--About Pull Request
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
 Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes
 with collaborators and add follow-up commits
 before your changes are merged into the base branch.


--about git rebas 
Rebase is one of two Git utilities that specializes in integrating changes from one branch onto another.
 The other change integration utility is git merge. Merge is always a forward moving change record.
 Alternatively, rebase has powerful history rewriting features.
 For a detailed look at Merge vs.
 Rebase, visit our Merging vs Rebasing guide. Rebase itself has 2 main modes: "manual" and "interactive" mode.
 We will cover the different Rebase modes in more detail below.


Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
 Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.
 The general process can be visualized as the following:

From a content perspective, rebasing is changing the base of your branch from one commit to another making
 it appear as if you'd created your branch from a different commit.
 Internally, Git accomplishes this by creating new commits and applying them to the specified base.
 It's very important to understand that even though the branch looks the same,
 it's composed of entirely new commits.
